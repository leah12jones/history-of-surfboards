      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>From a basic means of transportation made of bound reeds through to today’s ultralight high-flying foam composites, ‘The Surfboard’ provides a perfect example of the design developments and mutations that can occur when, over a long period of time, many people come together around a common purpose. Here, we present a chronology of the key moments in the history of surfboard design, as the foundation article for a series examining key designs and developments in the wave riding tool that makes this whole undertaking possible.</p>

      <h1>Early Origins</h1>
      <p>Around 300AD, Polynesians migrated east across the Pacific Ocean and settled the Hawaiian Islands, bringing with them their culture of he’e nalu.
        Surfboards from this period fall into one of three categories: the enormous regal Olo, the Alaia, and the commoners Paipo, all made from Ula, Koa, WilliWilli and sometimes even breadfruit trees.
        These flat, solid planks of wood were part of the code of kapu (taboos) that structured early Hawaiian society and were used in rituals, recreational activities, training for Hawaiian chiefs and as a means of conflict resolution.</p>

      <h1>Decades</h1>
      <h2>1900-1910's</h2>
      <p>Surfboard design in the first two decades of the 20th century was characterised by the deviation from local hardwoods and an experimentation with the different types of wood (especially redwood), that were being shipped to Hawaii from the mainland (primarily for use in construction). George Freeth, who is largely credited as spreading surfing to the U.S. mainland, cut his 16ft Alaia in half and experimented with redwood which led to the development of the ‘plank surfboard’ (a lighter, shorter and more manoeuvrable surfboard that was still straight and flat). In 1910, Duke Kahanamoku customizes his version of a “plank board” made of redwood, with a blunt nose and square tail, measuring 10 feet in length, 23 inches in width, 3 inches in thickness and weighing 70 pounds; a design that would be serve as a prototype for the widely available Swastika/Waikiki model (made out of pine wood), a couple of decades later.</p>

      <h2>1920's</h2>
      <p>The next major change in surfboard design was in 1926 when one of the most famous names in surf history; Tom Blake designed the first hollow surfboard. The board was constructed of redwood, it had hundreds of holes drilled in it and was encased with a thin board of wood on top and below the board. The board was 15 foot long, 19″ wide, 4″ thick and weighed 100 lbs. This new design was at first ridiculed by local Hawaiian’s jokingly calling it the ‘Cigar Board’ until they saw how much faster it was in the water. Blake’s hollow surfboard became a great success and became the first mass-produced board in 1930</p>

        <h2>1930's</h2>
        <p>At the same time, Meyers Butte, son of the founding partner of Pacific System Ready Cut Homes (a huge home building company) launched a line of Swastika branded solid wooden plank surfboards (early models were solid redwood, but by 1932 they were pine with redwood edges, and later balsa and redwood).
            In 1934, inspired by necessity – or rather the fact their boards weren’t “biting” the wave and slid out far too easily – John Kelly and Fran Heath took the next big step in surfboard design evolution when they shaved off parts of the rail and tail of one of their plank surfboards in an attempt to get more control and make their surfboards more responsive through turns. This adaptation was called the hot curl because it allowed the surfers to manoeuvre into the “curl” of the wave.
            In 1935 Blake adds a small 1’ long, 4” deep skeg from a small speedboat to the tail of his surfboard and is widely credited with inventing the fin.
            In 1937 the rise of the Nazis caused Pacific System Homes to rename the “Swastika” range “Waikiki”.</p>
