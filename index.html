      <p>From a basic means of transportation made of bound reeds through to today’s ultralight high-flying foam composites, ‘The Surfboard’ provides a perfect example of the design developments and mutations that can occur when, over a long period of time, many people come together around a common purpose. Here, we present a chronology of the key moments in the history of surfboard design, as the foundation article for a series examining key designs and developments in the wave riding tool that makes this whole undertaking possible.</p>

      <h1>Early Origins</h1>
      <p>Around 300AD, Polynesians migrated east across the Pacific Ocean and settled the Hawaiian Islands, bringing with them their culture of he’e nalu.
        Surfboards from this period fall into one of three categories: the enormous regal Olo, the Alaia, and the commoners Paipo, all made from Ula, Koa, WilliWilli and sometimes even breadfruit trees.
        These flat, solid planks of wood were part of the code of kapu (taboos) that structured early Hawaiian society and were used in rituals, recreational activities, training for Hawaiian chiefs and as a means of conflict resolution.</p>

            <h1>1900-10’s</h1>
            <p>Surfboard design in the first two decades of the 20th century was characterised by the deviation from local hardwoods and an experimentation with the different types of wood (especially redwood), that were being shipped to Hawaii from the mainland (primarily for use in construction). George Freeth, who is largely credited as spreading surfing to the U.S. mainland, cut his 16ft Alaia in half and experimented with redwood which led to the development of the ‘plank surfboard’ (a lighter, shorter and more manoeuvrable surfboard that was still straight and flat). In 1910, Duke Kahanamoku customizes his version of a “plank board” made of redwood, with a blunt nose and square tail, measuring 10 feet in length, 23 inches in width, 3 inches in thickness and weighing 70 pounds; a design that would be serve as a prototype for the widely available Swastika/Waikiki model (made out of pine wood), a couple of decades later.</p>

  <h1>1920's</h1>
  <p>The next major change in surfboard design was in 1926 when one of the most famous names in surf history; Tom Blake designed the first hollow surfboard. The board was constructed of redwood, it had hundreds of holes drilled in it and was encased with a thin board of wood on top and below the board. The board was 15 foot long, 19″ wide, 4″ thick and weighed 100 lbs. This new design was at first ridiculed by local Hawaiians jokingly calling it the ‘Cigar Board’ until they saw how much faster it was in the water. Blake’s hollow surfboard became a great success and became the first mass-produced board in 1930</p>

      <div class="thirties-text">
        <p>At the same time, Meyers Butte, son of the founding partner of Pacific System Ready Cut Homes (a huge home building company) launched a line of Swastika branded solid wooden plank surfboards (early models were solid redwood, but by 1932 they were pine with redwood edges, and later balsa and redwood).
            In 1934, inspired by necessity – or rather the fact their boards weren’t “biting” the wave and slid out far too easily – John Kelly and Fran Heath took the next big step in surfboard design evolution when they shaved off parts of the rail and tail of one of their plank surfboards in an attempt to get more control and make their surfboards more responsive through turns. This adaptation was called the hot curl because it allowed the surfers to manoeuvre into the “curl” of the wave.
            In 1935 Blake adds a small 1’ long, 4” deep skeg from a small speedboat to the tail of his surfboard and is widely credited with inventing the fin.
            In 1937 the rise of the Nazis caused Pacific System Homes to rename the “Swastika” range “Waikiki”.</p>

        <h1>1940’s</h1>
        <p>Advances in materials technology driven by WWII, such as the development and refinement of plastics, plastic foam (such as polyurethane foam) and fibreglass, begin to fuel experimentation in surfboard design and construction.
          In 1946 Santa Monica lifeguard and surfboard shaper Pete Peterson (the father of lifeguarding’s Peterson tube) made the first hollow moulded plastic surfboard, with a redwood stringer and sealed with fibreglass tape.
          In 1947 Joe Quigg created the ‘Darrylin’ board – a balsa and redwood shape (named after its owner) that weighed a surprising 25 pounds and later became the prototype for the ‘Malibu Chip’.
          Also in 1947, Quigg and Bob Simmons teamed up to build the first polyurethane foam-core “sandwich” boards – which were sheathed with a thin layer of plywood, had solid balsa rails and were covered with fibreglass. They also experimented with all-fibreglass fins, both ideas that would later be developed more in-depth.

        <p>In 1950, George Downing produces the first big-wave surfboard. ‘Rocket’ was a 10 foot surfboard; narrow, streamlined and with a pointed tail inspired by the ‘Hot Curl design’, but constructed from balsa, fibreglass and resin, it allowed Downing, Wally Froiseth, Woody Brown and others to push the limits of big wave surfing. In 1951, Downing introduces the removable fin system to his rocket design, but the idea would only be popularized in the following decade.
          Surfboard makers start to experiment more widely with new plastic foams such as polystyrene and polyurethane (developed during WWII) during the 1950s as a light and easy to shape alternative core material to Balsa.
          Later in 1958, the stringer starts to appear in surfboards as a means of strengthening the polyurethane foam blanks.
          Towards the turn of the decade, Pat Curren refined the design of big-wave surfboards by crafting 11-foot-long balsa guns that weighed around 40 pounds and gained recognition for their fine quality, contributing to his accomplishments as a big-wave rider.

        <p>In 1970, Gerry Lopez and Jack Shipley founded Lightning Bolt. They fine-tuned the popular design of the moment – the ‘rounded-pin single-fin’ – and added a coloured lightning bolt on the deck of all their shapes, causing a worldwide sensation.
          In 1972, Californian brothers Malcom and Duncan Campbell designed the ‘Bonzer’ – a three-fin model, where two keel-like side fins sit slightly ahead of the centre fin and two concaves run down the middle and tail sections. The design was claimed to be faster and more manoeuvrable than the standard single-fin boards.
          In the late 1970s, Brewer further developed his down rail profiles into the even harder “tucked under” edge.
          In 1977 Australian Mark Richards – with the help of Dick Brewer – redesigned and developed a 6’2” version of the twin-fin model, which became widely popular as “the ultimate small-wave board”.
          Throughout the mid and late ‘70s, the swallowtail joined the round-pin, square and diamond-tail – as one of the standard tail designs. </p>

        <p>In 1982, New Zealand shaper Allan Byrne adapts the concept of a ‘channel bottom board’ (first thought of by Australian Jim Pollard in 1974) into the tri-fin design. The design features elliptical channels in the rear half of the board with the intention of increasing speed by flushing water towards the tail.
          Also in the early ‘80s, the squash-tail (a square-tail with rounded corners) becomes popular and is chosen by most as a favourite for the newly introduced ‘thruster’ surfboard.
          After the popularization of the thruster, design changes through the rest of the ‘80s focused on refining the still boxy-railed shortboards to create thinner, lighter and narrower boards. An apparent “moment of calm” in design evolution gave space to attention to detail, that together with the popularization of the sport allowed an increase in retail prices.

        <p>Another mid-’90s development (cited by many as one of the decade’s most important) was the reinvention of the concave bottom configuration as the ‘single-to-double’, which consisted of a shallow and wide concave in the middle of the board flowing into two concaves through the tail, increasing the board’s speed and turning capability.
          In 1997, the idea of a ‘molded surfboard’ was popularised by California-based company The company developed a large range of models with a foam core wrapped in a layer of high-density sheet foam, epoxy resin and fibreglass, topped with polyurethane paint, resulting in a lighter and stronger board but retailing at a higher price and frequently labelled by purists as “soul-less”.
          The ‘90s saw the resurgence of longboard surfing, a movement that since it’s slump in the 1970’s had gradually been regaining popularity (this time on lighter surfboards and often with a three-fin setup). In the years that followed longboards began to represent a big chunk of surfboards sales – according to Clark Foam’s annual sales figures, over 50% of foam blanks sold were over 8’ long.

        <div class="two-thousands-text">
        <p>In the beginning of the 21st century, Carl Ekstrom (proponent and developer of the ‘asymmetrical’ surfboard concept in 1965) teamed up with Richard Kenvin, Ryan Burch and Hydroflex to produce surfboards based on his assymetrical theories.
          In 2004, shaper Tom Wegener started producing Alaias from paulownia wood in Australia. Professional surfers including Dave Rastovich, Rob Machado, Dan Malloy and Chris Del Moro’s explorations into the realm of finless wave-sliding (coupled with the fact that Alaias could be self-shaped relatively inexpensively by curious surfers) helped to popularise the concept of revisiting the Alaia design.
          Volume began to become a key surfboard dimension in the noughties, in part facilitated by the growth in CAD/CAM machine shaping allowing the volume of a surfboard to be easily calculated. Everyday surfers began to order more “user friendly” higher volume surfboards, and there was a distinct shift towards “short, fat, wide” shapes in the “everyday shortboard” market.
          In 2005, the world’s biggest polyurethane foam producer, Clark Foam, shut its doors suddenly and somewhat mysteriously, directly impacting board makers (causing a spike in the price of surfboards as world blank availability contracted), and prompting a “revolution” in alternative materials.

        <p>In 2007 renowned Swedish-American product designer Thomas Meyerhoffer launched a range of attention-grabbing hourglass-shaped longboards, which were produced and marketed by Global Surf Industries.
          By 2009, Richard Kenvin’s Hydrodynamica project had revived Bob Simmons’ 1940’s hydrodynamic planing hull theories, reapplying the concept to modern designs and inspiring surfer/shapers such as Ryan Burch, Tyler Warren and Daniel Thomson. Birch in particular rose to prominence when he began to ride a simple slab of un-glassed closed cell foam. In 2012 Firewire, now a global player based in California, partnered with innovative Australian shaper Daniel Thomson, adding his “TOMO” branded designs to their range as a sub-label and producing a line of unconventional boards such as ‘The Vader’ and ‘The Evo’ that featured Thomson’s interpretations of planing hull theory, rectangular noses, forked tails and wide, deep concaves. In 2014 Australian shaper Hayden Cox wins the first of three “Surfboard of the Year” awards for his Hypto Krypto surfboard, an all-round shortboard for small to medium-size waves that has become one of the best-selling surfboards ever.
